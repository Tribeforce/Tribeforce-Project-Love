## Tribeforce 'Project Love' (working title)

### SOFTWARE OUTLINE
Project Love (PL) is a web application centered around the detection and use of personal talents outside formal organisations, like companies, schools, etc... People create profiles that contain their talents. They can invite others to provide suggestions of new talents and feedback on existing ones.

People can set goals to develop the talents they choose to develop and ask feedback from a selective group of their contacts in how to do this most effectively. Once a goal is defined, it can be coupled with an opportunity that can be sourced from within organisations the individuals is part of or by anyone in their network. A goal in combination with opportunity provides possibility for an engagement between the two people or between the representative of an organisation and the individual (employer - employee, student - teacher, non-profit - volunteer, etc...). It is thus best suited for freelancers, mobile professionals, students, volunteers and people in a loosly organised or emergent form of collaboration.

The progress of the engagement and it’s effect on the individual's talent and the organisations ‘opportunity’ are logged in the application and is used to provide feedback and foster evolution of the individual. 

## USE CASE
PL is best suited for use within emergent and progressive types of (topic based) organisational forms that foster personal growth and happiness by people informally helping each other out to do what they are most effective at and explore that ever further. The end user is the individual and has total control over his or her data. Interaction with organisations is an option but the individual’s control over his or her data is always guaranteed.

### TECHNOLOGY

PL is designed to run on a LAMP stack and makes use of Laravel 4, Zurb Foundation and JQuery 2.0 technologies. A functional version is currently online. Access can be gained by simple request to stijn@tribeforce.com

### CURRENT STATUS
The software is not complete. A dev version is running in a single server environment, yet contains many bugs and incomplete elements. The backend is quite elaborately developed, the front end is still very rudimentary and needs quite some love.

We are actively looking for collaboration on this piece of software.
